### Project Overview

## What I learned

This project explores a single page layout with animations and clickable links. This is my first time building a website with HTML/CSS. I have tinkered before and written a few lines but this is the first time Ive had a full deliverable project. I learned a lot about how the structure of HTML/CSS works as well as how much time and effort is actually needed in order to produced a fully coded live website/page. I used media queries to make a responsive website in both a desktop and mobile view. There are clickable icons that link to their perspective locations. The layout is adjusted from a desktop to a mobile view for readability and accessability as well as adjusted for screen size.

## Problem Solving and Accessability

This single page business card website solves the problem of having to find contact information and portfolios across different sites/apps. etc. I addresses accessability by adding alt text tags and running colors through Adobe Color. 

## Feature, Fonts, Design, Mockups

The lava lamp animation makes this site stand out. I used lilitaone as my font choice as it gives the blocky and curved feel I was going for. I wanted a more playful color palette as I was pulling inspiration from a lava lamp I had as a kid. My svg vectors were created in Adobe Illustrator. My wireframes and mockups were done in Figma.
