##Project Overview/What I learned
This Project explores a single page layour with animations and lcickable links. This is my first full HTML/CSS project. I have tinkered before and written a few lines but this is the first time Ive had a full deliverable project. I learned a lot about how the structure of HTML/CSS works as well as how much time and effort is actually needed in order to produced a fully coded live website/page.
##Problem Solving and Accesability
This single page budiness card website solves the problem of having to find contact information and portfolios across diffreent sites/apps. etc. I adressses accesability by adding alt text tags adn runnin colors through ADobe Color. 
##Feature, Fonts, Design, Mockups
The lava lamp animation makes this site stand out. I used lilitaone as my font choice as it gives the blocky and curved feel I was going for. I wanted a more playful color pallete as I was pulling inspiration from a lava lamp I had as a kid. My svg vectors were created in Adobe Illustrator and My wireframing and mockups were done in Figma.
